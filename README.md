## Welcome to Infinite Alloys
Infinite Alloys is all about using natural metals to create millions of different alloys. While a very large majority
of these alloys won't have a purpose, many still will. These alloys will then be used to create machines, tools,
upgrades, etc.  
If you want to help, look through the issues tab for unresolved issues. If you don't know how to
use github, get help [here](https://help.github.com/). Join the [#InfiniteAlloys IRC channel on EsperNet](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=infinitealloys) to talk and ask questions.
