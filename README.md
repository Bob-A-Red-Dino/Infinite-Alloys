## Welcome to Infinite Alloys

Infinite Alloys is all about using natural metals to create millions of different alloys. While a very large majority
of these alloys won't have a purpose, many still will. These alloys will then be used to create machines, tools,
upgrades, etc. If you want to help, look through the TODO for unresolved issues.
